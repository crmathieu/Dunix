  PACKAGE COMPONENTS

  This package is designed to work with the BORLAND C compiler, but
  doesn't include this compiler. The LARGE memory model is the only
  one supported, therefore you'll have to install LARGE TURBO C library.


        DISK COMPONENTS
        ---------------

        - install.exe (installation program).

        - \TX\KERNEL directory which contains
          DUNIX kernel libraries.

        - \TX\TI directory which contains
          executable and overlay development
          tools files.

        - \TX\TI\HELP directory which contains
          help files

        - \TX\USR directory which contains kernel
          header files (.H) and where the user will
          have to create his program and header files


        To start the Multitasking Kernel for DOS application
        Development Interface, type "TI".


        NOTE
        ----
        If you have access to this shareware thru BBS, you'll
        have maybe some trouble to execute install.exe.

        LIBRARIES
        ---------

        - TXSML:   All system calls except SPY and windows
                   management.

        - TXSPY:   SPY library

        - TXWIN:   Windows library


  Installing DUNIX is easy:

  1)    Insert the diskette in any floppy and type
        "INSTALL.EXE"; this program creates the
        following directories on the hard disk:

                \TX\KERNEL
                \TX\USR
                \TX\TI
                \TX\TI\HELP

        The installation program then copies the files
        in their appropriate directory and updates a PROFILE
        file according to the chosen options.

  2)    After the installation program is finished,
        type "TI" to start the development interface.
        You will have to select the Option menu to
        check whether you accept the default values or
        not.

        Default values are:
        - Compiler and Linker path  -> C:\TC
        - C Libraries path          -> C:\TC\LIB
        - C Include path            -> C:\TC\INCLUDE
        - User path                 -> C:\TX\USR
        - DUNIX header files path  -> C:\TX\USR
        - DUNIX kernel             -> C:\TX\KERNEL
        - Help files path           -> C:\TI\TI\HELP


  Now, DUNIX is ready to be used. Enjoy this product, and if you
  want more, don't forget to register...
